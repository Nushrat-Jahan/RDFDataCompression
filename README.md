# RDFDataCompression
This repository is to upload my working files of my R&D project. Firstly, there were installation. Then converted RDF to Json-LD using rdflib library. Then the retrived Json-LD converted to other forms of Json-LD. Then used code to convert them into CBOR. CBOR data output is also there. Then used BGP mapping to get binary representation. Lastly, measured the byte size of RDF message we provided earlier.

# Run the files

1. Clone the repository
```
    git clone https://github.com/Nushrat-Jahan/RDFDataCompression.git
```
2. Run the RDFDataCompressionCode.ipynb in Jupyter notebook or upload it in the colab environment and run file. The running file result can be seen in my existing colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zhksgvbvbG31BaySs-OsiqHflDRvPdcK?usp=sharing)
